                <br/>
                <div class="orange-box">
                    <h5>Want to play this game?</h5>
                    <p>Type 'telnet 54.215.236.176 5020' on your terminal</p>
                </div>            

                <br><br><h5>Problem</h5>
                <p>
                    Story time! So, my fiancé and I are huge Family Feud enthusiasts. You know, that 
                    awesome TV show with Steve Harvey? Well, as much as we'd love to have Steve drop by and 
                    host a game night at our place, it's not in the cards.
                    So, we decided to bring the Feud to us and hit up Target for the board game. 
                    Turns out, the board game requires a minimum of three players (<i>1 host and 2 players</i>).
                    In the mission of finding a 2 player Family Feud game where a computer can be our host, 
                    we found arkadium.com which has an online version of Family Feud. But here's the catch – 
                    you can't pick your opponent. It's a random match-up every time.
                    <br>
                    <i>Can I automate this in a way where a computer can be a host and 2 players get the same question
                    exactly at the same time with Python? Heck yes!</i>
                </p>

                <br/><h5>Game Play</h5>
                <p>
                    Before we start coding, the first step is to understand the game play.
                    <br><br>
                    <img class = "python-image" src="/static/assets/gameplay.png">
                    <br>
                </p>

                <br/><br/><h5>The Challenge</h5>
                2 players need to get the same question <u>exactly at the same time</u>.
                <br/> 
                I could write a python code, build the game logic and have 2 clients run the python code at the same time. 
                However, it leaves to the possibility of human errors. Further, I don't want to give clients the power to 
                control the code.

                <br/><br/><h5>Architecture</h5>
                To address the challenges above, I decided to go with a client-server architecture.

                <br/><br/>
                <img class="small-image" src="/static/assets/familyfeud-architecture.png">

                <br/><br/><b>Server Setup</b>
                <br/>The server runs as a system service named "family_feud.service" on an AWS EC2 instance. It listens 
                    for incoming connections on port 5020.

                <br/><br/><b>Communication</b>
                <br/>I'm using sockets for communication between the server and clients. Clients connect to the server 
                via telnet.
                
                <br/><br/><b>Database Integration</b>
                <br/>A MySQL database stores questions, answers, and corresponding score values. The server connects 
                to the database to retrieve and manage questions during gameplay.
                
                <br/><br/><b>Multi Threading</b>
                <br/>Each connected client is handled in a separate thread, allowing the server to manage multiple 
                connections concurrently.
                
                <br/><br/><b>Question Selection</b>
                <br/>Questions are selected from the database. The server ensures questions are not reused until the 
                entire set has been exhausted. Each question is stored as a dictionary in the database. The guesses and the scores
                are stored as a list of dictionaries. Here's how it is retrieved:
                <br/><img class="small-image" src="/static/assets/dictionary.png">
                
                <br/><br/><b>Scoring Mechanism</b>
                The scoring mechanism is based on the player's guesses compared to the survey's top answers. 
                Retrieves the points from the SQL database.

                <br/><br/><b>Continuous Integration and Deployment</b>
                The server code is set up as a service, ensuring it remains "always-on". Automatic updates are pulled 
                from my Git repository every minute using a cron job, keeping the game up-to-date.
