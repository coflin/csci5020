                <br/>
                <p>
                    <br/><i>Automate your network. Because ain't nobody got time to manually configure every 
                        network device. We've got memes to browse, people!</i>
                </p>

                <br/><br/><h5>What is Network Automation?</h5>
                <p>
                    Have you ever found yourself buried under a mountain of repetitive network configuration tasks, 
                    wishing there was a better way? Network automation is like having a helpful robot that takes care of 
                    repetitive tasks in your computer network. Instead of doing everything by hand, like setting up connections 
                    or fixing problems, this robot does it for you quickly and accurately. With network automation, you can focus on the 
                    important stuff while the robot handles the rest, making your network more efficient and reliable.
                </p>

                <br/><br/><h5>But why automate your network when, say, configuring a VLAN can be done with just a two-line command?</h5>
                <p>
                    In today's fast-paced world of networking, where time is money and mistakes can be costly, automation is 
                    like having a superhero on your team. Instead of spending hours typing commands and hoping for the best, 
                    automation swoops in to save the day. 
                    <br/>Now you may ask, <b>why write a code that'll take longer to write than 
                    configuring, say a VLAN on a switch manually? Isn't this much faster?</b>

                    <img class="medium-image" src = "/static/assets/no_automation.png"/>

                    <br/><br/>Yes, you're correct! Configuring a VLAN on one switch manually is 100% faster than writing a code to configure it.
                    However, what if you were to configure a VLAN on 100 switches? Or 1000 switches? Or a million switches?
                    Network automation offers far-reaching benefits beyond mere convenience. Automation isn't ONLY about speeding 
                    up individual tasks; it's about transforming the way we manage and scale networks. By automating repetitive 
                    processes like VLAN configuration, organizations can ensure consistency, reduce human error, and scale their 
                    operations efficiently. Moreover, automation allows network engineers like us to focus on higher-value tasks, such as optimizing 
                    network performance, enhancing security measures, and innovating to meet evolving business needs. In essence, 
                    while a two-line command might suffice for a single VLAN, automation empowers organizations to unlock the full 
                    potential of their networks, enabling agility, resilience, and innovation.

                </p>

                <br/><br/><h5>Well, does this mean network automation's aim is to replace humans with machines? What about my job?</h5>
                <p>
            
                    Automating your network isn't about replacing people with machines; it's about 
                    empowering you and your team to tackle more strategic initiatives and drive business growth.
                    <br/>
                    Automation takes care of repetitive and mundane tasks, allowing network engineers like us to 
                    focus on higher-value activities that require human creativity, problem-solving, and critical 
                    thinking skills.
                    <br/><br/>

                    <br/><br/>
                    Our role as a network engineer remains crucial in designing, implementing, and maintaining 
                    network infrastructure. While automation streamlines certain aspects of network management, 
                    it doesn't eliminate the need for human oversight and decision-making. In fact, automation 
                    often enhances job opportunities by increasing the efficiency and scalability of network operations.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Moreover, network automation can have a significant impact on both capital expenditure (CapEx) and operational 
                    expenditure (OpEx). By automating routine tasks, organizations can reduce the need for manual labor and the 
                    associated labor costs, leading to OpEx savings. However, it's essential to consider the broader picture. 
                    While automation may lead to workforce reductions in some areas, it often creates new job opportunities in others. 
                    For example, as organizations implement automation in network management, they may require skilled professionals 
                    to design, implement, and maintain the automated systems. Additionally, automation can free up human resources to 
                    focus on more strategic and complex tasks that require creativity, problem-solving skills, and domain expertise.
                    Additionally, automation can improve resource utilization and 
                    optimize infrastructure deployment, resulting in lower CapEx expenses over time.

                <br/><br/><h5>Okay, I'm convinced. But how do I automate my network now?</h5>
                <p>
                    You've come to the right place! In the upcoming articles, I will introduce you to the world of 
                    network automation and how to setup a basic infrastructure. I'll be using GNS3 and Python to automate
                    the infrastructure. It's quick and easy to follow. 
                    Trust me, with this, you won't ever have to touch the CLI (<i>or maybe a little</i>). Stay tuned and 
                    happy automating!
                    <br/><br/>
                    Cheers!
                </p>
